Reasons as follows:  
  
* How does pair programming work?  
  - There are two roles: The Driver and the Navigator

      - Takes longer to produce a product but is of higher quality code that requires less troubleshooting and debugging  
      - Enhances technical skills, communication, and develops an enjoyabality of a workplace  

  * Engaged collaboration
