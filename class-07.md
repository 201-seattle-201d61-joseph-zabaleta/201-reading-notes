### Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)  

- Table arrange data in a column and row format and this is good for data and other types of information.  
- `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page.  
- a table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created using an `<tr>` element.  
- Inside each row there ar enumber of cells represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a header).  
- you can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the `rowspan` and `colspan` attritbutes.  
- For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`  87

## JS Readings  

### Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)   

A constructor is a new keyword and object constructor to create a blank object.  
- `Object()` constructor is built into a javascript land.  
- This allows us to build objects, adjust objects, add/remove to/from objects.  
- utilize keywords such as `new` , `delete` 

- Array are objects, a special kind, they have key value pairs, using the index values and the value at each index.  
- You can combine arrays and objects to create a compelx data structures:  
  - Arrays can store a series of objects (and rememver their order).  
  - Objects can also hold arrays (as values of their propertiess).  

* Three groups of built-in objects  
  - Browswer object model
    -  Examples: `window.print()` and `window.screen.width;`  
  - Document object model  
    - Examples: `document.getElmentById('one');` and `document.lastModified;`
  - global javascript objects  
    - Examples: `hotel.toUpperCase();` and `Math.PI;`


  - Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.  
  - Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.  
  - An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.  
  - In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.  
  - Web browswers implement objects that represent both the browswer window and the document loaded into the browswer window  
  - JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.  
  - Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
