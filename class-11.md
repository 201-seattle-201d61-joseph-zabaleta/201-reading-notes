* Controlling sizes of images in CSS  
  - Most websites have consistent image sizes throughout there site.  Small, Medium, Large

  - Rather than using img align properties, web developers tend to class img's and use the float property.  They also use margin to ensure text doesnt touch the picture.  
  - Centering image can be achieved through `display: block` and setting the `margin` left and right to auto if `width` is set.  
  - Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically . 

* You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on the page. `background-image`

* `background-image` can be displayed once or even repeated acrosss the whole background using `background-repeat`  

* To reduce the number of images our browswer has to load you can create image sprites.
